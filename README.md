# air-fids
> A flight information display system (FIDS) is a computer system used in airports to display flight information to passengers, in which a computer system controls mechanical or electronic display boards or monitors in order to display arriving and departing flight information in real-time. The displays are located inside or around an airport terminal. A virtual version of a FIDS can also be found on most airport websites and teletext systems. In large airports, there are different sets of FIDS for each terminal or even each major airline. FIDS are used to inform passengers of boarding gates, departure/arrival times, destinations, notifications of flight delays/flight cancellations, and partner airlines, et al.

## [https://air-fids.vercel.app/](https://air-fids.vercel.app/)
This web-app, made with Nuxt.js, is an online FIDS for arrivals and departures of flights from all the major airports around Australia. It uses [air labs'](https://airlabs.co/) api to fetch flights from each of the airports. It features sorting, searching, pagination, a dark mode toggle, and a cute lil plane when you click on a flight for more information.

Hi team @ Ovatu! This is my submission for the coding test you sent me. It was really fun to build! It fulfills all the requirements and a little more. I put lots of love into all the styling and features - my personal favourite is the cute lil plane you see when you open a flight modal. I hope this shows well how much I value this opportunity and how passionate I am about software development. I'm really hoping to move forward with ya'll, so if you like what you see please let me know! Either way, I had fun making this little app, and it's something nice to add to my portfolio. Thanks for giving me a shot,

Ed
